# Disclaimer:
The only way I could think of to get the miners name on each block on the block list is to do the heavy processing server side. I think one would need to get a list of all users (wasnt able to find an endpoint that did that), and marry each block up to each miner using the miners address.

I realized this right at the end of the project at which point it was too late to pivot to something like next.js. 
I did manage to find an enpoint that gets uminer by their address but I ruled that out immediately cause it would have meant n amount of API calls.


# Final thoughts
I tried my best to aggregate the data as best I could and learnt quite a lot about crypto in the process. Thank you for the oportunity, I thoutoughly enjoyed the assessment.
